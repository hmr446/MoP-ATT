Known Issues:
------------
- --Lots of missing spells in the config menu, *this part is mostly **manual data entry,** so please help!*--its over now
- Some spell data may be incorrect, I.E CD times, or charges on spells that should or shouldnt have them.--its over now
- Glow effect is rough, switching to different library... Eventually.
- Initial login doesnt populate icons when set to No Anchor. Changing *anything* in the options menu, reloading UI or joining a group will fix this.
- Trinket support is not quite ready.--you can self added spellid：42292
- Glyph support soon.
- Desaturate for spells with charges non-functional. Will add option to disable desaturation.
- Disabling borders requires a reload.
- Unable to change font for timer.--ATT\libs\compat 116line maybe can change（i guess）
- Untested in PvP with functions such as Dampening %
